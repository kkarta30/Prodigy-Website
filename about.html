            <p>
                Prodigy was created by four first year Creative Media & Game Technologies students. We were given the assignment to create a arcade like game
                using the three following guidelines & properties: <span>Sensation, Build & Monsters</span>. During the brainstorm period we settled pretty quickly on a 
                tower defense type game, since it peaked our interests and thought it would be a bit out of the ordinary for this type of assignment. Later we figured out that
                building a game as such was not as straight forward as we had anticipated and came across lots of bumps. This turned out to be a valuable learning experience 
                for working on such a project.
