            <h1>About our team</h1>

            <p>
                Prodigy was created by four first year Creative Media & Game Technologies students.
                 We were given the assignment to create an arcade like game
                using these three elements: Sensation, Build & Monsters.
                During the brainstorm period we combined all of our best ideas and settled on a 
                tower defense game. Prodigy was created. 
                We thought that a tower defense game would be a bit out of the ordinary, & also really fun to make. 
                Later we figured out that
                building a game as such was not as straight forward as we had anticipated and came across lots of bumps. This turned out to be a valuable learning experience 
                for working on such a project.

                Bas & Fernando were responsible for the development of the game. 
                While Bas was the leading programmer, Fernando took more of a supporting role.
                Most visual design in the game was done by Donovan, while Kevin worked on the logo & the website's design.
                What was most valuable about this process, was our ability to work as a team, and discuss different possibilities and opportunities on the fly.
                Great communication, planning and motivating each other helped us push this project to what it has become!
