                <h2>What is Prodigy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Prodigy is a browser based tower defense game! Your goal is to defend the home base from waves of evil slime monsters.
                    The land of Winehaven is being terrorized by these monster like creatures & they are out for blood. 
                    Strategically place different types of towers to defend yourself from the waves of continuously stronger growing enemies..
                </p>

                <p>.</p>

                <p>
                    This game was created by four first year students as a part of CLE4 for their bachelor study Creative Media & Game Technologies.
                    The goal was to create an arcade like game using the three following guidelines & properties: <span>Sensation, Build & Monsters</span>. 
                </p>

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>
                    Prodigy consists of two phases; the attack phase & the building phase. 
                </p>

                <p>.</p>

                    <p><span>Build Phase</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Build and move defending towers to strategic places to defend yourself from the monsters.
                        Use your mouse & left click to drag a tower. But use your time well, you only have 30 seconds!
                    </p>

                    <p>.</p>
                
                    <p><span>Attack Phase</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Your towers will start their fire while waves of monsters commence their attack!
                        Lets hope your home castle will hold up..
